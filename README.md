ICS MAJOR PROJECT
MATHBEE CHAMPIONSHIP SIMULATOR
The Math Bee Championship Simulator is a simple program written in C that simulates a math bee competition. In this competition, participant is  asked a series of math questions.
There are mainly 4 levels Based on level of difficulty named  :"EASY","MEDIUM","DIFFICULT"&"EXPERT" and user may choose his level and play the corresponding level.
In the code we made functions to generate each question in the each level.


Concepts Used :
Conditional statements,Functions,pointers,strings,arrays,loops,2 inbuilt functions srand and rand
Below are the functions  defined in our project to generate and display the questions :
1.integrate_question : It generates a integration question
2. calculate_integral_terms: calculates the integral terms of a polynomial.
3.evaluate_integral :It evaluates the integral of a polynomial at a given value X.
4.diff_question :     
Instructions to run:
Code Editor: You will need a code editor to work with the project files. We recommend using Visual Studio Code for its excellent support for various programming languages and extensions.

Compiling Tool: The project is developed using the C programming language, so you will need a C compiler to build and run the code. We suggest using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which is widely used and available on most platforms.
