Instructions to run:
Code Editor: You will need a code editor to work with the project files. We recommend using Visual Studio Code for its excellent support for various programming languages and extensions.

Compiling Tool: The project is developed using the C programming language, so you will need a C compiler to build and run the code. We suggest using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which is widely used and available on most platforms.
