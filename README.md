ICS MAJOR PROJECT
MATHBEE SIMULATOR-(A Math Adventure)
The Math Bee Championship Simulator is a simple program written in C that simulates a math bee 
competition. In this competition, participant is  asked a series of math questions.
There are mainly 4 levels Based on level of difficulty  and at the beginning of the game, the player
is prompted to select a difficulty level from the options: EASY, MEDIUM, DIFFICULT, or EXPERT.
In the code we defined  functions to generate each question in the each level. As the levels
progress, users are challenged with increasingly complex mathematical concepts



Concepts of C programming language  Used :
Conditional statements,Functions,pointers,strings,arrays,loops,2 inbuilt functions srand and rand

Type of Questions:
1.Arithmetic Operations: Basic operations like addition and subtraction are executed using loops to iterate through the digits of the numbers, add or subtract corresponding digits, and manage carries or borrows.

2.Area Calculations: To compute the area of various geometric shapes, specific functions for each shape are implemented. For instance, the function calculateRectangleArea() is defined to compute the area of a rectangle using length and width as parameters.

3.Unit Conversion: Functions are defined to convert units. For example, convertKilogramsToGrams() takes weight in kilograms and returns the equivalent weight in grams. Each function accepts the value to be converted, applies the conversion formula, and returns the result.

4.BODMAS Expression Evaluation: The expression is broken down into tokens (operands and operators) for processing. Stacks are used to manage operators and operands during evaluation, following the BODMAS rule. The expression tokens are iterated through, evaluating sub-expressions according to the BODMAS rule.

5.Arithmetic and Geometric Progression Problem Solving: The type of progression (AP or GP) is identified based on the pattern of terms. Formulas are used to calculate the nth term and the sum of the first n terms for both AP and GP. Separate functions are implemented for these calculations.

6.Quadratic Equation Solving: Two integers representing the sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation are accepted. The coefficients of the quadratic equation are calculated using these roots, and the discriminant is computed to determine the nature of the roots. The roots are then computed based on the value of the discriminant and displayed.

7.Riddle Questions Generation: A riddle is randomly selected from a collection and presented to the user. The user’s answer is validated against the stored answer for the selected riddle, and feedback is provided based on the correctness of the user’s answer.

8.Pattern Printing: User-defined parameters such as the number of rows and columns are accepted to determine the pattern’s size and shape. Nested loops are used to iterate through the pattern’s elements, and specific patterns are generated using conditional statements or mathematical calculations. The pattern is displayed to the user with potential enhancements like borders, colors, or additional shapes.

Instructions to run:
Code Editor: You will need a code editor to work with the project files. We recommend using Visual Studio Code for its excellent support for various programming languages and extensions.

Compiling Tool: The project is developed using the C programming language, so you will need a C compiler to build and run the code. We suggest using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which is widely used and available on most platforms.
